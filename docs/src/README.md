# Introduction
This documentation is created automatically with [markdown](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html). 

## Installation
To write documentation you will need to install [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) and [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). It is also recommended to have [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) installed to simplify git commands. You can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a text editor.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository so you have a local copy with `git clone https://github.com/zoup-eatery/zoup-eatery-tech /path/to/folder`. It is recommended to create a new `branch` for any changes if there are multiple users modifying the repository. This can be created using Github Desktop. 

In the terminal/command prompt, navigate to the directory `cd /path/to/folder/docs/src` and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies. Once this is complete, you can start the development server with `npm run dev`. The default port is 5000, so the server can be accessed at `http://localhost:5000`. 

::: tip
You can install "markdown preview" extensions in VS Code to see live-previews in the editor.
